You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowin' dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

And now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Comin' in out of the rain
You hear the jazz go down
