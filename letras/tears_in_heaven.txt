Would you know my name
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in Heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in Heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in Heaven?
I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in Heaven
