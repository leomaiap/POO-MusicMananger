No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba-observing the hypocrites
As they mingle with the good people we meet

Good friends we have had
Oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
